/**
 * Background-hydration bookkeeping for the Agor store.
 *
 * The `liveRevisions` / `hydrationGeneration` counters and `runHydration` live
 * as NON-REACTIVE module-level state alongside the store. Two reasons it is
 * module-level rather than zustand state:
 *  1. The realtime entity actions (`agorRealtimeActions`) are module singletons —
 *     they MUST be able to bump the per-collection counter without a React hook.
 *  2. These counters bump on EVERY socket event (the hot path); making them
 *     subscribable store fields would re-render every `useStore(agorStore)`
 *     consumer on each bump. So they stay plain mutable module vars with
 *     `useRef` semantics — internal bookkeeping, not UI-subscribed.
 *
 * `useAgorData` is mounted once (App.tsx), so in production the module singleton
 * IS the single instance. Tests re-`renderHook` the singleton, so the hook
 * resets the revision baseline on (re)mount (`resetHydrationRevisions`) and
 * cancels any straggler loop (`cancelAllHydrations`). Generation tokens are kept
 * strictly MONOTONIC (never reset to 0) so a stale loop from a prior mount can
 * never collide with a fresh loop's generation.

// Skip-apply-on-race background hydration retry schedule. A hydration applies
// its full-set snapshot ONLY if no live write to the target collection(s)
// raced the fetch (proven via the per-collection `liveRevisions` counters);
// if one did, the snapshot is DISCARDED and refetched from a fresh revision
// baseline — never overlaid/reconciled.
//
// It retries UNTIL it lands a quiet window, and NEVER gives up: skipping the
// apply forever would leave Home empty/incomplete indefinitely on a busy
// workspace, because live subscriptions deliver only CHANGES, not a backfill of
// existing rows (board switching doesn't refetch, and a reconnect may never
// fire). The first few retries are immediate (the race window is ~one fetch RTT,
// so a single transient race converges instantly), then capped exponential
// backoff lets a sustained live-write burst settle without busy-looping. Each
// retry RE-snapshots the revision and RE-fetches; a racy snapshot is never
// force-applied. Per-collection quiet windows are short, so this converges fast
// (branches almost immediately; sessions once their write churn quiets).
//
// Delays PRECEDE the attempt they guard (the delay for attempt N runs before
// fetch N, not after it). Loops are cancelled — not abandoned mid-flight — via
// the per-collection generation tokens (`hydrationGeneration`): a newer
// hydration (reconnect) or an unmount/reset supersedes older loops so they stop
// retrying and never apply a stale snapshot or leak a timer.
