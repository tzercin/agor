/**
 * Narrow store selectors for entity-map consumers.
 *
 * Each whole-map selector is a module-level function so a subscribing component
 * passes the SAME selector reference on every render (no per-render closure
 * allocation on hot paths). Because the store preserves slice references on
 * idempotent writes (`Object.is` short-circuit), `useAgorStore(selectX)` only
 * re-renders its consumer when that specific slice's reference changes.
 *
 * Board-scoped data uses a curried factory so a consumer subscribes to exactly
 * one board's bucket: a patch to another board's objects leaves this board's
 * array reference untouched, so the subscription doesn't fire.
