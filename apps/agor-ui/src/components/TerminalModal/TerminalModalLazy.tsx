/**
 * Lazy-loaded wrapper around the xterm-backed TerminalModal.
 *
 * The real modal (`TerminalModal.tsx`) statically imports `@xterm/xterm` and
 * its addons (~300KB). Wrapping it in React.lazy keeps xterm off the initial
 * bundle, which most sessions never need since they never open a terminal.
 * This wrapper defers the import until the modal is first opened:
 *
 *  - Until `open` first becomes true we render nothing (a closed modal has no
 *    visible output anyway), so the xterm chunk is never fetched.
 *  - On first open we mount the React.lazy inner inside a Suspense boundary.
 *    Once mounted it stays mounted across subsequent open/close cycles, which
 *    keeps the modal always-mounted (and preserves the close animation).
